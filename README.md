# AdeptGraphics

**AdeptGraphics** is a lightweight C++ graphics project using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) and [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/), built with `g++` via a Windows batch script.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- `g++`

---

## 🛠️ How to Build

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/adeptgraphics.git
   cd adeptgraphics
   ```
2. Setup GLFW libs:
    2.1. Copy `glfw3.dll` to `adeptgraphics/`
    2.2. Copy `libglfw3dll.a` to `/lib`

2. Run the build script:

   ```bash
   ./build.bat
   ```

5. Make sure `glfw3.dll` is next to the executable after building (copy it manually if needed).

## 🚀 Running the App

After a successful build, run the app from the same directory as `glfw3.dll`:

```bash
./AdeptGraphics.exe
```

## ❗ Files You *Shouldn't* Commit

| File           | Reason                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `glfw3.dll`    | Binary runtime; better to re-download or bundle in releases only |
| `imgui.ini`    | Autogenerated ImGui settings (UI state, positions) |
| Object files (`*.o`) | Intermediate build files                    |
| Your compiled `.exe` | Optional: usually not committed             |

Use a `.gitignore` like this:

```
*.o
*.exe
imgui.ini
*.dll
```
